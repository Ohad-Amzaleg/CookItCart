# Meal Scheduler and Shopping Cart Generator

This project is a web application created with React (TypeScript) in the frontend and Node.js in the backend. It allows users to select meals, add them to their schedule, and automatically generate an ingredients cart based on the selected meals.

## Features

- **Meal Selection:** Users can browse and select meals from a list of available options.
- **Schedule Management:** Users can add meals to their schedule for specific dates.
- **Automated Ingredients Cart:** The application automatically generates an ingredients cart based on the selected meals in the schedule.
- **MongoDB Database:** MongoDB is used as the database to store meal information, user schedules, and ingredient details.
- **AWS Hosting:** The frontend of the application is hosted on AWS Amplify, while the backend is deployed using Elastic Beanstalk.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - AWS Amplify (hosting)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (database)
  - Elastic Beanstalk (deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend and backend directories and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install

   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the MongoDB connection in the backend by adding your MongoDB URI in the configuration file.

4. Start the frontend and backend servers:

   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm start

   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:8080` for the backend.

## Usage

- **Frontend:** Open the web application in your browser. Select meals, add them to your schedule, and view the generated ingredients cart.
- **Backend:** The backend provides APIs to handle meal selection, scheduling, and cart generation.

## Deployment

- **Frontend (AWS Amplify):** The frontend can be deployed to AWS Amplify. Configure Amplify with your GitHub repository and set up continuous deployment.
- **Backend (Elastic Beanstalk):** Deploy the backend to Elastic Beanstalk by configuring the environment and deploying the Node.js application.
